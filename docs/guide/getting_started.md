## Getting Started

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

"Kubernetes as a Service" (Codename: Kubernikus) makes it easy to run Kubernetes clusters that are natively integrated with OpenStack. It is a managed service that takes care of installing, upgrading and operating the cluster.

It provides an easy entry to deploy containerized payloads and getting started
with Kubernetes without the operational overhead of setting up Kubernetes.
Due to the tight and convenient integration with OpenStack it becomes easy to
combine VM and cloud-native workloads.
